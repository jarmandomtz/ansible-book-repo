# Pull mode
Running ansible in pull mode

Having many Ansible changes to many hosts makes running ansible risky. For this situations pull mode mechanism is preferable, which automatically pull changes being the host responsible for request their update each certain time
Command "ansible-pull" starts pulling code from github repo.

## Requeriments
Becouse ansible an git it's gonna work remotely, there should be installed on hosts,
- git & ansible installed on EC2 f
- git repo containing Ansible playbook with in this case 3 roles: nodejs, helloworld, crontab
  - nodejs grouping needs for install nodejs
  - helloworld grouping needs for install apache and app files
  - crontab grouping needs for install cron, copying files and load cront command

## Steps to execute ansible on pull mode
- Install git & ansible in host computers using AWS, [code repo](https://github.com/jarmandomtz/aws-book.git)  [Terraform file](aws-book/chapter04/tr-ansible-aws-pull/tr-ansible-webapp-pull.tf)
- Create [git proyect](https://github.com/jarmandomtz/ansible-book-repo.git) for Ansible SCM of infra
  - Localhost execution specification: localhost in crontab command & helloworld.yml in Ansible project, using Template in crontab role of playbook & YAML Terraform file
- Execute Ansible since Terraform first time, configuring crontab daemon. This execution load ansible-pull command which will execute update of host in a timed loop

Configuration validation
- Connect to host IP to validate
- Check existent crontab commands

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/EffectiveDevOpsAWS.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP
[ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP ~]$ crontab -l
# Cron job to git clone/pull a repo and then run locally
*/2 * * * *  /usr/bin/ansible-pull -U https://github.com/jarmandomtz/ansible-book-repo.git helloworld.yml -i localhost >>/var/log/ansible-pull.log 2>&1
```

## StepÅ› to add code-deploy for WebServer
- Add aws code deploy dependency

```
% mkdir library
% curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yogeshraheja/Effective-DevOps-with-AWS/master/Chapter05/ansible/library/aws_codedeploy > ./library/aws_codedeploy
```
